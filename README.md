# odin-recipes

First assignment of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Created a basic website that links to three recipes, used heading levels, divs to separate the sections of each recipe into description, steps and ingredientes, used unordered lists for the ingredients of each recipe and ordered lists for the steps on how to prepare said recipes, and added images with alt text.

Done in 2/6/2023.
